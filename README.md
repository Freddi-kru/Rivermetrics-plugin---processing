[![RM logo con ombra](other/icons&logos/RM2.png)](other/icons&logos/RM2.png)

A set of tools for extracting river metrics useful for identifying the hydro-morphological characteristics and analysing the geomorphological evolution over time of a watercourse.
It is developed in [Python-3 environment](www.python.org) and is compatible with QGIS 3.22 and later.

The plugin is divided into two parts: the first part is an experimental plugin with a dock in the main QGIS interface, while the second part is a set of tools integrated into QGIS processing.

The [RiverMetrics plugin](https://github.com/pierluigiderosa/RiverMetrics.git) is in the official QGIS repository (experimental flag) and can be easily installed using the standard procedure. 

The QGIS RiverMetrics processing tools can be found here.
